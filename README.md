Welcome to the repository for my Java programming internship at CodSoft! This repository contains all the tasks and code contributions I've worked on during my internship. Below, you'll find an overview of the internship details, the projects I've worked on, and any other relevant information related to my experience.
Certainly! Here's a rephrased version of your description, ensuring it's unique:

# Project Overview

# Task 1: Number Guessing Game
This project generates a random number and prompts the user to guess it. The game provides feedback based on whether the guess is too high or too low, and tracks the score across multiple rounds.

**Features**:
- Random number generation.
- User input for guesses.
- Feedback on each guess.
- Score tracking over multiple rounds.

# Task 2: Student Grade Calculator
This tool calculates a student's total marks and computes the average percentage. Based on the results, the program assigns a grade and displays the final outcome.

**Features**:
- Input for total marks.
- Calculation of average percentage.
- Automatic grade assignment based on predefined criteria.
- Display of results.

# Task 3: ATM Simulation
This project simulates an ATM interface, allowing users to withdraw, deposit, and check their account balance. Input validation ensures that only valid transactions can be processed.

**Features**:
- Withdraw and deposit functionality.
- Balance checking.
- Input validation for safe account operations.
- Simulated bank account interaction.

# Task 4: Currency Converter
A currency converter that uses real-time exchange rates to allow users to convert between different currencies. The program provides an intuitive interface for easy conversion.

**Features**:
- Fetching real-time exchange rates.
- Converting currencies based on user input.
- Simple, user-friendly interface for currency conversion.

# Task 5: Student Management System
A system designed to manage student records, including adding, updating, and deleting student information. The system is built using Student and StudentManagementSystem classes and offers a basic user interface for interacting with student data.

**Features**:
- Add, update, and delete student records.
- Store data using collections or external storage.
- Simple user interface for interacting with the system.

## How to Explore

Each task is stored in its own directory with source code, and necessary files for understanding the project. To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

2. **Navigate to a Specific Task Directory**:
   Each task is located in its own subdirectory.
   
4. **Run the Code**:
   - Open the project in your preferred IDE (like visual studio code or Eclipse).
   - Execute the `Main` class or the relevant entry point for each project.

5. **Review the Source Code**:
   - Each directory contains Java source files (`.java`) along with a brief explanation of the task.
   - Follow any specific instructions inside the directory to run the program or make modifications.
